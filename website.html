<img src="">
<p>Salutations earthlings, welcome my very first webpage! I’m Bia Gillies, a novice to coding. I am just learning how to write HTML, and soon I’ll be a
<em> web young jedi master</em>! As I learn, I will add to this page the various things that I am able to do. That way, this website will serve both as a place to show off my skills as well as a reference to me so that I can look at what I did in the past if I ever need to remember how to do something. </p>
<h2 style="background-color: darkolivegreen"> Milestones</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Growing up, my family had a shared hardwired desktop that I became admistly addicted to.</li>
    <li>Computers became my source of entertainment and discovery as Youtube developed and most tasks transitioned to web friendly.  </li>
    <li>In college, I was introduced to coding through a program called R-Script that helped to analyze statistical data. The language and outputs fascinated me; multiple of data all explained with a few lines of code. </li>
    <li>I continued to use code programming for running statistical tests in my current job of behavioral analysis. </li>   
    <li>I joined Refcode to explore coding in-depth and explore the vast possibilities that are available in the coding world. </li>
